# Project Vision: Secure Personal Agentic Platform

## The "Why"
In an era of increasing AI ubiquity, the balance between capability and privacy is often skewed toward corporate siloing. This project exists to reclaim technological sovereignty for the individual. It is born from the need for a highly capable personal assistant that understands the deepest intricacies of its user's life without ever exposing that data to external entities unnecessarily.

Our "Why" is to provide a "Second Brain" that is:
1. **Private**: Your thoughts, struggles, and sensitive data stay on your hardware.
2. **Personalized**: Specifically tuned for neurodivergent (AuDHD) needs, reducing cognitive load and bridging execution gaps.
3. **Powerful**: Leveraging the best of local and commercial AI models through an intelligent, security-first routing engine.

## Objectives
- **Operational Independence**: Create a system that runs independently of any single provider (Antigravity-independent).
- **Hybrid Intelligence**: Achieve 99% cost efficiency by routing simple tasks locally and complex reasoning to precision APIs.
- **Security Assurance**: Implement a "Trust but Verify" model where different AI models audit each other's outputs.
- **Neuro-Supportive**: Automate the "boring stuff" and provide compassionate coaching to support mental health and productivity.
