# Security & Privacy Rules

## Core Privacy Requirements

- **Pseudonymous Identities**: Support pseudonymous identities as a first-class citizen (DEC008).
- **Data Sovereignty**: User data should remain on their home instance as much as possible.
- **Minimisation**: Only collect and store the absolute minimum data required.

## Encryption Standard

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: All private messages must be E2EE (DEC009). See I004 in [RAIDD.md](file:///home/dale-rogers/Projects/active/personal/between/RAIDD.md) for ongoing key management design.
- **Data at Rest**: Sensitive database fields must be encrypted using AES-256.
- **Data in Transit**: All communications must use TLS 1.3/HTTPS.

## API Security

- **Authentication**: All APIs must require valid authentication (JWT or Instance-level auth).
- **Authorisation**: Implement strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- **Validation**: All inputs must be validated using Zod schemas.
- **Rate Limiting**: Apply rate limiting to all public endpoints.

## Security Practices

- **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets. Use environment variables.
- **Logging**: Never log PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or sensitive tokens.
- **Audits**: Refer to D004 in [RAIDD.md](file:///home/dale-rogers/Projects/active/personal/between/RAIDD.md) for required security audits.
