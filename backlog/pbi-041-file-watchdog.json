    "description": "Service that monitors configurable directories (e.g. ~/Downloads, ~/Projects) for new/changed files; emits events (path, event type) for downstream Content Classifier or Event Bus. Options: polling, or inotify/watchdog (Python watchdog). Config: list of paths and optionally patterns.",
