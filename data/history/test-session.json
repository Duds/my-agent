Is it a deep, mystical violet with hints of iridescence, or a playful, neon-lavender that seems to float off the page? Either way, I love the creativity behind it. \ud83d\ude0a\n\n(And if you ever need a color palette for a project, I\u2019d happily help brainstorm shades that match your Antigravity Purple vibe!)"
